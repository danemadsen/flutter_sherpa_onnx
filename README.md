# Dart Sherpa-ONNX

A Dart package to use the [k2/sherpa-onnx](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx) speech recognition platform.

This is undergoing some heavy restructuring at the moment so things may be a bit disorderly.

## Example

To see an example:
```
dart --enable-experiment=native-assets run example/sherpa_onnx_dart_example.dart
``
