# flutter_sherpa_onnx

A Flutter package wrapping the sherpa-onnx speech recognition package. Uses a background isolate for speech processing. This is stable but zero documentation and support so you'll have to figure things out on your own (alternatively if you want to engage me on a contract basis, please touch base @ nick.fisher@avinium.com).
